This Website was constructed using [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) , [Poole](http://getpoole.com), [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and many more frameworks and tools freely available online. 
The well written article by Joshua Lande, [How I Created a Beautiful and Minimal Blog Using Jekyll, Github Pages, and poole ] (http://joshualande.com/jekyll-github-pages-poole/) helped me through the whole process. 

###Thank you all.
