I currently work as a Software Developer at Arista Networks, Nashua, New Hampshire.
I graduated from North Carolina State University at Raleigh in December 2015, with a Masters degree in Computer Science.

Before that, I wrote (and fixed) code for Cisco Intrusion Prevention Sensor(IPS). My work had been predominantly on C++,C and Linux. i plan to dabble a bit on web development. I love anything to do with compilers, programming languages and operating systems.And after 3 years in Cisco IPS, i love network security.
