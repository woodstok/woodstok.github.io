I'm a software developer. I write (and fix) code for Cisco Intrusion Prevention Sensor. My work has been predominantly on C++,C and Linux. i plan to dabble a bit on web development. I love anything to do with compilers and programming languages.And after 3 years in Cisco IPS, i love network security. 

Other than that, i love to play table tennis and football,watch sitcoms and movies, and read literary fiction. I listen to alt-rock and acoustic-folk mostly. I started running last year and can pant my way through 10Kms now. In 2014, I plan to finish a half marathon, dust off my old guitar and start busking.
